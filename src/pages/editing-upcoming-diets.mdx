# Editing Upcoming Diets

After generating the diet it will become the client's active diet. You can still
edit which days are checkin days, transfer the diet to a different coach, and 
see a history of all diet changes. Additionally you'll now be able to edit 
individual meals, change the diet length, copy and paste days/weeks, duplicate 
the diet, delete the diet, and post the diet for the client.

<EditingMeals />

Clicking the "Edit" button allows you to change the time when the meal is
scheduled as well as the meals macros. Clicking the "List" button allows you to
choose which proteins, veggies, carbs, and fats the meal should contain.

        alt="food_list.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

<ChangeLength />

To change the length of the diet click on the "Diet Length" button. Note that
if the diet has already started then there may be days already completed by the
client.

        src={change_length_form}
        alt="change_length_form.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

<BulkEdits />

Selecting multiple meals, days, and/or weeks allows you to make bulk edits. Use
the "Edit Selected Meals" button to change macros or add comments to all
selected meals.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image 
        src={edit_selected}
        alt="edit_selected.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>
<div className="px-3">

        src={edit_selected_form}
        alt="edit_selected_form.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

<CopyingMeals />

To copy a day, click the "Copy Day to Day(s)" button and select the days you'd
like to copy from and to.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image 
        src={copy_day}
        alt="copy_day.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>
<div className="px-3">
    <Image 
        src={copy_day_form}
        alt="copy_day_form.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

To copy a week, click the "Copy Week to Week(s)" button and select the week(s) 
you'd like to copy from and to.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image 
        src={copy_week}
        alt="copy_week.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>
<div className="px-3">
    <Image 
        src={copy_week_form}
        alt="copy_week_form.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

<LockingMeals />

Toggling the lock slider on an individual meal, a day of meals, or a week of
meals prevents that meal/those meals from being edited. Any bulk edits made
will not be applied to locked meals.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image 
        src={locking_meals}
        alt="locking_meals.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

<PostingDiets />

After you've configured the diet, click on the "Post Diet" button to share it
with the client. Note that you will still be able to make some edits after
posting but after you post the diet the client will be able to interact with and
make progress on it. Posting the diet updates its status from upcoming to
active.

        className="rounded-2xl"
