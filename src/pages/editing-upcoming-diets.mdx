# Editing Upcoming Diets

After generating the diet it will become the client's active diet. You can still
edit which days are checkin days, transfer the diet to a different coach, and 
see a history of all diet changes. Additionally you'll now be able to edit 
individual meals, change the diet length, copy and paste days/weeks, duplicate 
the diet, delete the diet, and post the diet for the client.

<EditingMeals />

Clicking the "Edit" button allows you to change the time when the meal is
scheduled as well as the meals macros. Clicking the "List" button allows you to
choose which proteins, veggies, carbs, and fats the meal should contain.
