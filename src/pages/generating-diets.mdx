# Generating Diets

Before you generate a diet for you client you'll want to make sure you have all
of their relevant information.

After your client completes the intake form there will be an upcoming diet that
requires your attention. From the coach dashboard, navigate to the client's
specific dashboard and click on their upcoming diet.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image 
        src={generating_diets1}
        alt="generating_diets1.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>
<div className="px-3">
    <Image
        src={generating_diets2}
        alt="generating_diets2.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

On this page you'll find all of the client's intake form responses. 
Additionally you'll find a thread where you can chat with the client, a graph
that will eventually track the client's weight, an activity feed that will
eventually store updates from the client's checkins, and an edit button that
allows you to change the information that will be used to generate a diet.

<EditingIntakeFormResponses />

Editing the intake form will allow you to change the information that the client
entered. After making changes, click "Save & Exit" to update the information.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image
        src={editing_intake_form_responses}
        alt="editing_intake_form_responses.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

<MealsPerDay />

The diet will initially be set to 3 meals per day. Set each day's meal count to
the appropriate amount and use the "Repeat" buttons to copy the previous day's
count.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image
        src={meals_per_day}
        alt="meals_per_day.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

<CheckInDays />

The diet does not have any check-in days set initially so you'll need to choose
which days work best for you and your client.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image
        src={check_in_days}
        alt="check_in_days.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

<TransferDiet />

Transferring a diet sends the client to a different coach. The diet then becomes
theirs to update and manage.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image
        src={transfer_diet}
        alt="transfer_diet.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

<DeleteDiet />

Deleting a diet wipes all information currently stored in the diet. Note that
this includes the client's intake form responses so if the client needs a diet
they will need to fill out the intake form again.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image
        src={delete_diet}
        alt="delete_diet.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

<EditHistory />

The edit history for this diet will initially be empty but after the diet is 
generated it will store changes made to any meal.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image
        src={edit_history}
        alt="edit_history.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

<GenerateDiet />

After checking that all of the input information is correct, click the "Generate
Diet" button. Set a length for the diet and click "Generate".

<div className="px-3">
    <Image
        src={generate_diet}
        alt="generate_diet.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>
