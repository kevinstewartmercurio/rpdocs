# Coach Dashboard

The coach dashboard is where you'll be able to see how your clients are doing
with their diets. In order to access the coach dashboard, you'll need to login.

<LoggingIn />

Following this link: 
[https://coaching.rpstrength.com/login](https://coaching.rpstrength.com/login)
leads you to a page prompting you for your email. After entering your email
you'll receive a code that allows you to log in.

<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row">
    <div className="px-3">
        <Image
            src={login_email}
            alt="login_email.png"
            className="rounded-2xl"
        />
    </div>
    <div className="px-3">
        <Image
            src={login_code}
            alt="login_code.png"
            className="rounded-2xl"
        />
    </div>
</div> 

This brings you to the coach dashboard. From here you can invite users and see a
list of your clients.

<InvitingUsers />

You can invite a new client or coach using the "Invite User" button. After you
fill out the invite form with the new user's information they'll receive an 
email inviting them to join the program. Note that when you invite new clients
you'll need to assign them to a coach that they can work with.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image
        src={invite_user}
        alt="invite_user.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>

<ClientList />

The coach dashboard is where you'll find information about all of your clients.
Clicking on a client's "Dashboard" button takes you to their specific dashboard
where you can view their active, upcoming, and past diets.

<div className="px-3">
    <Image
        src={client_list}
        alt="client_list.png"
        className="rounded-2xl"
    />
</div>
