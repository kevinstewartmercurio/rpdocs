# Coaching Dashboard 

The coaching dashboard is where you'll see client information. As an admin
you'll be able to see every RP client and as a coach you'll be able to see the
clients that you are working with. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<DietDashboard />

Once a user submits their intake form you'll be able to review, edit, and
generate a diet.

After generating a diet there will be a period of time before the client
receives it when you can make edits (during which time the diet will remain in
a pending state). After you finalize your edits and post the diet the client
will receive an email to let them know their diet is ready.

Inside the diet dashboard you'll be able to see the client's weight graph, chat 
with the client, edit the diet, view the diet's edit history, and follow the 
client's progress with the diet.
