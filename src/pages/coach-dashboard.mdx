# Coach Dashboard

The coach dashboard is where you'll be able to see how your clients are doing
with their diets. In order to access the coach dashboard, you'll need to login.

<LoggingIn />

Following this link: 
[https://coaching.rpstrength.com/login](https://coaching.rpstrength.com/login)
leads you to a page prompting you for your email. After entering your email
you'll receive a code that allows you to log in.

<div className="flex">
    <div className="pr-4">
        <Image
            src={login_email}
            alt="login_email.png"
        />
    </div>
    <div className="pr-4">
        <Image
            src={login_code}
            alt="login_code.png"
        />
    </div>
</div> 

This brings you to the coach dashboard. From here you can invite users and see a
list of your clients.
