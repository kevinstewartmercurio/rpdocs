# Managing an Active Diet

After posting a diet you still have all of the edit functionality that you had
when you were editing upcoming diets (with the exception of deleting the diet).
Now the client will log their completed meals and check in with you on specified
days. 

<EndingDiets />

After the client has gone through the entire diet you'll need to click the 
"Complete Diet" button. This will update the diet's status from active to
completed.
